Advent of Code
==================================

Well, I am resurrecting this repository in 2025 as being a manager leaves nearly
no time for development during work these days.  I am going to turn 2025 into
the year of advent, using each month to represent a specific year of the advent
of code.

Since I am starting this in Feburary though, so for February I am going to
work on both year 2015 and year 2016 before moving forward with the rest of the
years of advent of code.

Lets get started!
