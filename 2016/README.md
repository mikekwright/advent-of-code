Advent of Code - 2016
============================================

This is for the 2016 days that are going to overlap with the ones from 2015
(in the sense that I should be doing a day from each, every day).

For this second year, I am going to user another language that we use at work
that I am not as familar with, as it will give me a chance to catch up on a
few of the differences between how developers using this language function.
This is using the kotlin language. 

Days
--------------------------------------------

* [Day 1 - Not Quite Lisp](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1)

How to run
--------------------------------------------

This is another nix 
I know that not everyone is into nix, but I have been using nixos as a daily driver
for both home and work (well work, until they required management software that was
not compatible with the nixos system).  I know that it is not for everyone, but it
is easily one of my favorite things to use and work with.

To kick off the tests in this folder you will want to use the provided flake.nix
that is included that gives you the downloaded experience and will run the solution
for the specific days in question.

* `nix develop` - drops you into a shell with commands for each day
