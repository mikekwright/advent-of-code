Advent of Code - 2015
============================================

Of course I am not working on the advent of code in 2015, but this is where it
started, so lets start from the very beginning.

For this first year, I am trying to play a little catch up (since I am a month)
into 2025 and haven't started, so we will stick to a single, well known language
in this case we will go easy with python (specifically python 3.12)

Days
--------------------------------------------

* [Day 1 - Not Quite Lisp](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1)

How to run
--------------------------------------------

I know that not everyone is into nix, but I have been using nixos as a daily driver
for both home and work (well work, until they required management software that was
not compatible with the nixos system).  I know that it is not for everyone, but it
is easily one of my favorite things to use and work with.

To kick off the tests in this folder you will want to use the provided flake.nix
that is included that gives you the downloaded experience and will run the solution
for the specific days in question.

* `nix develop` - drops you into a shell with commands for each day
